    <h2>Matthew Stapley</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Matt,<br>I would like to present a <br>few pieces of work that I have<br> done over the years from education<br> and personal projects. I would like to clarify <br> that the majority of my work was done on a<br> college computer and saved to a github repository <br> under a college email which they have since teminated.</p>

    <p>This is a project that I<br> made for my mum, 
        she resells chocolate<br> from facebook and I thought it would be a good<br> idea to develop a website for her to sell and<br> get more leads from.<br>

        College Project 1
    </h2>
    <p>Well, college projects. While I was at college we were going through the <br>pandemic.
        Alot of my work was done from home, but all stored on the<br> cloud and my college email.
        I did have a github repository where I <br>stored my finished project, but this was also on a college email
        which <br>I no longer have access to as they close the email down once you finish<br> your course.
        This means I have minimal of what I created at college <br>and only screenshots of early on projects
        that I had sent myself.</p>
        <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>This project below was one of my first projects that I made during college. In <br>this game there are multiple levels will collectable items. some of these items<br> are good which give you boosts such as double jump or 2x speed. 
        The others are <br> Bad in which they take a life away. you have 2 lives so if you hit it twice its game <br>over and you would respawn at level 1.

        <h2>College Project 2</h2>

        <br>

        <p>The next project was a class project, but sadly, I do not have the complete version of it. <br>
            The part I have is from the initial days when two classmates and I worked on the project. <br>
            The game is a LEGO exploration game in which you collect coins and other items to level up. <br>
            The clip you are about to see only presents the movement, parts of the map, animation, and the double jump feature. <br>
            This project finished with only one level, unfortunately, but it was very detailed once we completed it, with an inventory menu and multiple collectibles along the route.</p>
